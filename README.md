# AutoPyTorch
AutoPyTorch is an open-source library that automates the architecture search process of deep neural networks. It provides a modular pipeline architecture that can be used to construct customized machine learning pipelines for classification, regression, and other tasks.


## Requirments  

 ```
!pip install autoPyTorch
```
## Notebook description
The Cifar10 notebook ['[autoPytorch_examples.ipynb'](https://github.com/ilyas4225/AutoPyTorch/blob/main/autoPytorch_examples.ipynb)] contains the tabular classification task with digits dataset, wine quality dataset , and with cifar10 dataset.

The notebook ['[Iris_Tabular_Classification.ipynb'](https://github.com/ilyas4225/AutoPyTorch/blob/main/Iris_Tabular_Classification.ipynb)] contains the tabular classification task with Iris dataset and visualization of the model performance.



 A Python file in the repository ['[Cifar10.py ](https://github.com/ilyas4225/AutoPyTorch/blob/main/Cifar10.py)] contains the  code for Autopytorch image classification pipline with cifar10 datadset.


To Run this code the command is as

 ```
python.Cifar10.py
```

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to create and train an image classification pipeline using the autoPyTorch library. By performing this demonstration on the CIFAR10 dataset.
